In 2013, I graduated Amherst College with a B.A. Cum Laude in Computer Science and Music.

My senior thesis explored methods to detect unintentional code obfuscation in JavaScript.  By examining code syntax and other features such as white space and line breaks, I developed a methodology to determine if a particular sample of code was obfuscated or not.  While the test sample of unintentionally obfuscated code limited broader conclusions, it was was highly enjoyable and I learned a lot about coding tests, scientific writing, and working in a small lab.

While at Amherst, I was the chapter president of Habitat for Humanity, created a hydroponic window farm for our cafeteria, and played piano and chamber music.
