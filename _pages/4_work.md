I work as a campaign data engineer at [Girl Rising](http://www.girlrising.com/) where I develop organizing tools, dynamic maps, story sharing platforms, e-commerce systems, and maintain daily operations of our dynamic web content.

Previously, I worked as an intern under Dr. Lou Yongqi at [TEKTAO](http://en.tektao.com.cn/), a design research firm in Shanghai, China, designing systems to encourage urban-rural interactions, especially through the lens of agricultural tourism.

I was an intern for New York-based clean cookstove start up, [BioLite](http://www.biolitestove.com/) where I helped identify market segments by designing, deploying, and analyzing pre-launch surveys from potential customers.

As an intern at the [Vertical Farm](http://www.verticalfarm.com/) project under Dr. Dickson Despommier, I researched lighting and waste systems for large scale indoor agriculture.
