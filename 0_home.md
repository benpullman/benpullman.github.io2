With a strong belief that technology can enhance and further understanding in education and the arts, I am currently a campaign data engineer at [Girl Rising](http://www.girlrising.com/), a movement for girls' education. I develop tools that leverage campaign data to improve the impact of the movement.

In my spare time I enjoy playing piano and trombone, listening to and analyzing music, especially that of Brahms, going to art galleries, observing wildlife, making home-brewed coffee, and eating cheese.
