I mainly focus on mixed media art as it relates to multimedia installation and piano performance, especially Debussy.  I am currently playing trombone in a student production of Verdi's Un ballo in maschera.

I enjoy making coffee using Chemex and V60 pourover methods and on an old Swiss manual level espresso machine.

Below is a animation I created about a garbage truck that is alergic to garbage.
